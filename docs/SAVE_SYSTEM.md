# Xandaris II Save System Documentation

## Overview

Xandaris II uses Go's built-in `encoding/gob` package for save/load functionality. This provides automatic serialization of complex data structures including interfaces, making it much more robust than JSON for game state persistence.

## Why Gob?

- **Automatic Interface Handling**: No custom marshaling needed for `[]Entity` slices
- **Efficient**: Binary format, faster and more compact than JSON
- **Type-Safe**: Go-specific format with full type information
- **Simple**: Minimal boilerplate code required

## Save File Format

### File Details
- **Extension**: `.xsave`
- **Format**: Binary (gob-encoded)
- **Location**: `saves/` directory
- **Naming**: `<PlayerName>_<Timestamp>.xsave`
  - Example: `Player_2024-01-15_14-30-45.xsave`

### Version
Current save format version: **2.0.0-gob**

## What Gets Saved

### Complete Game State
1. **Galaxy Data**
   - All star systems (40 systems with positions and connections)
   - Hyperlane network
   - Galaxy generation seed

2. **All Entities** (automatically via gob)
   - Stars (type, temperature, mass, etc.)
   - Planets (with all properties, populations, resources)
   - Resources on planets (deposits with extraction rates)
   - Buildings on planets (mines, factories, etc.)
   - Stations in systems
   - Resource storage (amounts and capacities)

3. **Player Data**
   - Player name, color, type (human/AI)
   - Credits
   - Home system and planet references
   - All owned planets and stations
   - Population statistics

4. **Construction Queues** ✨ NEW
   - All buildings/items in construction
   - Progress percentage and remaining ticks
   - Queue order preserved
   - Credits spent are preserved (no loss on reload!)

5. **Game State**
   - Current tick number
   - Game speed setting
   - Game time (formatted for display)

## Usage

### Saving a Game

**Quick Save (In-Game)**
```
Press F5
```
The game saves automatically with your player name and current timestamp.

**What Happens**
1. Creates `saves/` directory if needed
2. Captures complete game state
3. Exports construction queues from ConstructionSystem
4. Encodes everything with gob
5. Writes to `<PlayerName>_<YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS>.xsave`

### Loading a Game

**From Main Menu**
1. Launch game
2. Select "Load Game"
3. Choose save file from list (shows player name, game time, save date)
4. Game resumes exactly where you left off

**What Happens**
1. Opens and decodes gob file
2. Reconstructs all game objects
3. Restores construction queues
4. Rebuilds entity references
5. Initializes tickable systems with saved context
6. Resumes at exact tick with correct speed

### Listing Saves

The main menu automatically displays all available save files with:
- Player name
- In-game time when saved
- Real-world date/time of save
- Sorted by most recent first

## Implementation Details

### Type Registration

All serializable types are registered in `init()`:
```go
func init() {
    gob.Register(&entities.Star{})
    gob.Register(&entities.Planet{})
    gob.Register(&entities.Resource{})
    gob.Register(&entities.Building{})
    gob.Register(&entities.Station{})
    gob.Register(&entities.System{})
    gob.Register(&entities.Player{})
    gob.Register(&entities.Hyperlane{})
    gob.Register(&entities.ResourceStorage{})
    gob.Register(&tickable.ConstructionItem{})
}
```

### Construction Queue Handling

**Saving**
```go
// Get all queues from ConstructionSystem
constructionQueues := constructionSystem.GetAllQueues()
// Returns map[string][]*ConstructionItem

// Encode with rest of game state
encoder.Encode(saveData)
```

**Loading**
```go
// Decode entire save file
decoder.Decode(&saveData)

// Restore queues to ConstructionSystem
constructionSystem.RestoreQueues(saveData.ConstructionQueues)
```

### Benefits of Construction Queue Saving

- **No Credit Loss**: Players don't lose credits on buildings in progress
- **Progress Preserved**: Buildings resume from exact progress point
- **Queue Order Maintained**: Multiple queued items stay in order
- **Timing Accurate**: Remaining ticks calculated correctly

## Save File Metadata

While save files are binary, basic metadata can be read without fully loading:
- Version string
- Player name
- Save timestamp
- Game time
- Current tick

This allows the main menu to display save info quickly.

## Error Handling

### Save Errors
- Directory creation failures
- File write permission issues
- Encoding errors (rare)

All errors are logged to console with descriptive messages.

### Load Errors
- File not found
- Corrupted gob data
- Version mismatches (future)
- Missing registered types

Errors shown to user in main menu for 3 seconds.

## Performance

- **Save Time**: ~20-50ms for typical game state
- **Load Time**: ~50-100ms for typical game state
- **File Size**: ~100-500KB (much smaller than JSON)
- **Memory**: Minimal overhead, efficient encoding

## Limitations

### Cannot Save (Yet)
- Active fleets/ships (not implemented in game)
- Market/trade data (not implemented)
- Diplomatic relationships (not implemented)
- Research progress (not implemented)
- Event history/log

### Format Limitations
- **Go-Only**: Can't read saves in other languages/tools
- **Binary**: Not human-readable (debugging harder)
- **Version Sensitive**: May break with major struct changes

## Best Practices

### For Players
1. **Save often** - Press F5 regularly
2. **Use descriptive names** - Player name appears in filename
3. **Check construction queues** - Verify in-progress buildings after load
4. **Keep backups** - Save files are small, keep multiple versions

### For Developers
1. **Always register new types** - Add to `init()` when creating new entities
2. **Test save/load** - After any struct changes
3. **Maintain compatibility** - Consider migration if breaking changes needed
4. **Version bumps** - Update version string for format changes

## Debugging

### Console Output
The save/load system provides detailed logging:
```
[SaveSystem] Game saved to: saves/Player_2024-01-15_14-30-45.xsave
[SaveSystem] Saved 40 systems, 1 players, tick 1234
[SaveSystem] Loading game from: saves/Player_2024-01-15_14-30-45.xsave
[SaveSystem] Reading 234567 bytes from save file
[SaveSystem] Decoded save data: version=2.0.0-gob, player=Player, systems=40
[SaveSystem] Restored 3 construction queues
[SaveSystem] Game successfully loaded: 40 systems, 1 players, tick 1234
```

### Common Issues

**"gob: type not registered"**
- Solution: Add missing type to `init()` registration

**"EOF" or "unexpected EOF"**
- Corrupted save file
- Try older save or start new game

**Construction queue missing items**
- Check if ConstructionSystem is initialized before restore
- Verify tickable systems are registered

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Auto-save every N minutes
- Save slots with screenshots/thumbnails
- Save file compression (gzip wrapper)
- Save file validation and repair tools
- Migration system for format upgrades
- Cloud save support
- Multiple save profiles

### Compatibility Strategy
Version string allows detection of old formats for future migration:
```go
if saveData.Version == "2.0.0-gob" {
    // Current format
} else if saveData.Version == "1.0.0" {
    // Old JSON format - migrate
}
```

## Technical Notes

### Gob Encoding Details
- Streams structured data
- Self-describing format (includes type info)
- Handles pointers and circular references
- Preserves nil values
- Platform-independent (within Go)

### Memory Considerations
- Entire save is encoded/decoded in memory
- For 40 systems: ~5-10MB peak during save/load
- Minimal fragmentation due to efficient encoding
- Garbage collector handles cleanup automatically

## Conclusion

The gob-based save system provides robust, efficient game state persistence with minimal code complexity. The automatic handling of interfaces and nested structures makes it ideal for complex game data like Xandaris II's entity system.

**Key Advantages:**
✅ No custom serialization code needed
✅ Handles complex nested structures automatically
✅ Construction queues preserve player investment
✅ Fast and compact binary format
✅ Type-safe with compile-time checks

For most use cases, this system "just works" - allowing developers to focus on game features rather than save/load logic.
